Many popular supermarkets and chains can be find easily on google maps. However, there are many hidden small grocery and local markets available in many areas where people cannot search in internet and find it. For example, there are few Korean markets available in Darwin city area, but it is not visible to many people in internet. Therefore, we are developing a search engine to find those hidden markets based on different people interests and locality.
